# Greetings! ðŸŒ±

Take a look at

<span style="font-weight: bold">[[Your first note]]</span>

to get started on your exploration.

This digital garden template is free, open-source, and [available on Martin's GitHub](https://github.com/mroberts1/digital-garden-jekyll-template).

The easiest way to get started is to read this [step-by-step guide explaining how to set this up from scratch](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll). If you need any help, my [DMs are open on Twitter (@mroberts333)](https://twitter.com/vaillancourtmax). DM me there! ðŸ‘‹

Have fun!
